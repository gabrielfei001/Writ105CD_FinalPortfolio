                <p>Hi! My name is Gabriel and I'm a 4th year Statistics and Data Science major at UCSB. 
                    <br><br>
                    This portfolio was made for the Writing with Code class I'm taking with Dr. Daniel Frank. Writing with Code was actually the perfect class for me.
                    I became fascinated with video games ever since I was a child, and my interest in games eventually spread to an interest in game design. So given my 
                    love of games/game design as well as the substantial amount of coding that's required of my major, this class really fits the mold of what I'm interested in. 
                    But not only was this class a good fulfillment of my interests, I also got to learn about what nuances go into game design, as well as see games/code in a light
                    that I've never seen them before, that is through the lens of rhetorical and procedural analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase different Code Experiments, papers and projects that reflect the growth in thinking I've gone through as both 
                    a programmer and a writer, as well as exemplify the many rhetorical/procedural techniques I've picked up through this class.

                        <br><br>
                        <p>In this code experiment, I built upon a previously created code experiment's story in which the player must explore a jungle and 
                            traverse through ancient ruins to survive being stranded. Throughout the game, the player has the freedom to make different choices 
                            that could potentially have an impact on the outcome and events of the game, for example whether or not a player chooses to pick up an 
                            item could potentially take away an option from their future choices. Unlike the previous code experiment which used Inky, I opted to 
                            use Ren'Py to incorporate audio and visual elements in hopes of creating a more immersive environment for the player. I wanted the player to 
                            feel as though they themselves were transported to this jungle and ruin area, that when faced with dangerous, fearful situations, they too 
                            could feel that feeling of shock and awe, but if anything I hoped to capture the player's attention all the way to the end of the game.
                            <br><br>
                            Because I ended up using Ren'Py for this code experiment, I had to find free, open sourced assets on the web to use as visual elements in my game.
                            And from this experience, I definitely appreciate OSS(open source software) communities much more as they offer free assets to those in need without
                            ulterior motive, really exemplifying Brock's idea from Chapter 3 of <i>Rhetorical Code Studies</i>, that because there's no ulterior motive, and there's 
                            no middle man between the consumer and the creator, a tight knit relationship can be formed, I definitely feel a good relationship has formed between me 
                            and the creator of the assets I used.
                            <br><br>
                            Overall from this code experiment, I really got to build the foundation of what it means to incorporate narrative and character development into game design.
                            Jenkin's reading <i>Game Design as Narrative Architecture</i> encouraged me to focus on the mechanics of the game (such as spaces, choices, narrative ambience), 
                            and how the structure of the game and characters I create will shape the experince of a narrative. And it was from this code experiment that I was able to build 
                            upon that narrative building foundation in later code experiments.

                        <p>For this code experiment, Professor Frank challengd us to bring some life into our code by building an NPC/entity that 
                            converses and reacts with player choices or actions. So to take on this challenge, I really tried to incorporate narrative world-building and 
                            impactful player choices in this code experiment. The game itself starts off with a flashback and for the most part not much context is given as 
                            to what's happening or why things are happening, the player is just thrown into the game to discover the world as they play and immerse themselves. 
                            Each choice the player made contributes to the main character's morality and the NPC's perspective of you as the main character, these values work in
                            opposite effect. By the end of the game, depending on what items you picked up along the way, what your morality score was at, and what the NPC's judgement 
                            score of you was, different endings would happen. I hoped that by making the game this way, the player wuld be challenged by their own viewpoints throughout 
                            the game as they tried to pick the "best" option, and maybe even open themselves up to a new perspective by picking an action that wouldn't normally align 
                            with their viewpoints, such challenges can be seen in choices like stealing food to feed your starving self, robbing someone in order to gain money, or even 
                            killing someone that backstabs you.
                            <br><br>
                            There was one particular reading that inspired this code experiment design idea and that was James Paul Gee's <i>Are Video Games Good for Learning</i>. In it, Gee 
                            talks about using empathy within a complex system and experience through simulation (p. 2 & 3), expressing how we as game designers can think about how different 
                            regions of the system are being simulated while under the guise of the system as a whole. As an example, for my code experiment as a whole, to have a sense of 
                            realism in my game, I consider and think about how the player might react or respond when faced with certain moral choices and in doing so, I'm able to simulate 
                            empathy and emotion, and get the player to invest both emotion and intellect to the player they're embodying, creating a more engaging, realistic simulation of
                            the world.
                            <br><br>
                            From this code experiment, I learned how powerful the interaction between player and artifact simulating emotions can really be. As the player interacts and invests
                            their emotion and intellect into the artifact, the game comes alive, becoming an engaging world the player can get lost in. And it's through this exchange that
                            things such as morality, can be easily addressed, meaning we can use engaging and deeply interactive games to make a case for deeper topics that need to be addressed.
                            Overall, I think the game is successful in challenging the player's morality in a subtle, yet chilling way, as we get to see their consequences first hand being simulated
                            in the game.

                        aimed to show how through different procedural rhetoric, defined as th ecreation of systems that respond to inputs which, from them, create 
                        particular outputs, support the "message" of the game and influence the player. I broke the paper up into three parts, first describing the 
                        game itself and how it plays, then describing how certain elements within the game such as atmosphere, appeal to logic and emotion, help influence 
                        the player, and finally where the influence of the player is taking them, that is, why are we influencing them, what could be the meaning behind 
                        the game, and for this part I looked into possible theories of the meaning behind the game.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this first experience of analyzing a game from the rhetorical/procedural lens, I learned just how much work actaully goes into making a 
                        game so engaging that it leaves the player with a message. After having played so many games in my life, I never once thought about questions such
                        as "What is the game trying to tell people?" or "How could different strategies to grab the players attention, help teach them better?", and so now
                        as I look back on the games I have played or even play today, I'm left wondering about these more in-depth questions that's more than just, "Is the game 
                        fun?".

                        <p>For the Final Group project, my group wanted to raise awareness for the increasing issue of climate change and find a way to address 
                            the serious topic in a more easily accesible way. We also hoped to provide practical examples and solutions to this issue so that 
                            the player themselves could take action and become the start of a much needed change, because despite how much the topic of climate 
                            change gets blasted on the news, very little change has actually occured to stop it.
                        <br><br>
                        The game we created was centered around the player as the main character, walking freely in an urban city that's filled with NPCs. These NPCs offer
                        scenarios and different lifestyle choices in accordance with those scenarios, and depending on what the player picks out of those choices, their 
                        "environmental score" will go up or down, which will give different endings depending on the score's value. There's a good and a bad ending, 
                        in which both of these endings contain NPCs that tell you the consequences of the choices you made. We wanted to make this game replayable and fun,
                        so that whatever outcome the player got the first time, it would be engaging enough for the player to want to see the other ending, and from that learn 
                        the good/bad lifestyle choices that can affect our climate.

            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
                <br>
                <p>As someone that has been interested in both games and code from a young age, this course has opened a new lens to see both games and code through. I've 
                    learned how to not only analyze games and think about design more from a player's perspective, but in regards to designing games, the player experience 
                    is king, it's how your message will get across, it's what the player will take from the game, and how the game might change their perspective, so 
                    prioritize the player experience. But in terms of the game itself and systems present within a game, we must think about how they work together with 
                    the player experience to produce something that's not just impactful or engaging, but ultimately enjoyable, since it is a game after all. One of the 
                    coolest ideas I got to take away from this class is the idea of coding becoming a literacy. Vee puts it in <i>Literacy and Power</i> in <i>Coding Literacy: 
                    How Computer Programming is Changing Writing</i>, that having literacy equates to holding power, those who are  "illiterate" when it comes to coding will 
                    be blind about the code that is around them, different things under the hood such as data usage and distribution, cookies, all of that is out of the 
                    control of the "illiterate" user and they will be subject to the control of the literate user. It's cool to me because we can clearly see coding becoming 
                    more and more prevalent in our society, which means more and more people will be "illiterate" to code and thus subject to the power of those who understand 
                    code, which then in turn gives the skill of code and understanding it more importance. What once was for "nerds", what once wasn't considered a staple, has 
                    now become a staple to the modern literate person, and to see this shift in perspective and move towards the age of code and computers and games, 
                    is really really cool. Also, the adaptation of literary rhetorics onto coding and games, awesome...
                    <br><br>
                    All in all, as I stated in the intro, this course was essentially perfect for me. I enjoyed every part of it, from the flexibility and freedom of the code 
                    experiments (it was from this that I learned so many new languages), to the analysis of artifacts and systems, to even just Professor Frank's eccentric 
                    lectures and attitude, I learned so much from this class and will definitely be taking the new found game development foundation, coding skills and 
                    procedural rhetorics into my future.
